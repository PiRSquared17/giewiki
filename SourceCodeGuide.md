# Introduction #
The source code includes the giewiki.csproj file which is a convenient way to load it in Visual Studio 2005+. Currently nothing meaningful happens if you try to build the project, as it is all python and script that doesn't need to be built. People on other platforms  have no use for this file. In any case, test run it using the Google App Engine Launcher.
