How to deploy giewiki at your own appspot site.

= Requirements =

In addition to having your own (free) App Engine account (go to https://appengine.google.com/start if you haven't one already), you will need [http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.4/ Python 2.5 (or 2.6)] and the [http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html App Engine SDK] 

= Adaptation =

To deploy giewiki to your own site, you have to first edit the *app.yaml* file, changing the first line: 
{{{
application: giewiki
}}}
..to name your appspot subdomain in stead of giewiki.

= Deployment =

Actual deployment can be performed using the *appcfg.py* script as described [http://code.google.com/intl/da/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadinganapp.html here]

What that page doesn't say, however, is that on some platforms (Windows and Mac), you can launch the process directly from the Google App Engine Launcher which is a GUI app that comes with the App Engine SDK.

If this is _not_ the first version that you deploy to a particular site, you need to explicitly set the new version as the default, using the app engine dashboard at http://appengine.google.com (under Administration/Versions) - this is so that you can revert to the prior version, if needed.

There is currently no way to deploy content together with the code, but if you need to, read http://code.google.com/intl/da-DK/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadingdata.html.

Beware that if you are upgrading an existing application, it may be quite a while before it is fully functional, because the server needs to rebuild the indexes which is a task that is queued for batch processing. Under heavy load it may take several hours, but you can monitor the process at appengine.google.com.
