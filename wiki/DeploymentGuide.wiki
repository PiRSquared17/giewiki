How to set up giewiki either for local use _-or-_ hosted by Google at your own appspot.com (sub-)site.

== Software Requirements ==

You will need [http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.4/ Python 2.5 (2.6 or 2.7 seem to work as well)] and the [http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html App Engine SDK] from Google, both of which are also free (recent Mac or Linux boxes already have Python; if your're unsure, open a terminal window and type python).

== Hosting requirements ==

Unless you are setting it up on behalf of someone else, you will need to have your own (free) App Engine account. Go to https://appengine.google.com/start if you haven't one already - the process requires a phone capable of receiving text messages for the purpose of identification.

= Adaptation =

To deploy giewiki to your own site, you need to download and unpack giewiki-1.x.zip - _or_ you can pull the bits directly from Subversion, if you have software to do so. Either way, you need to change one file, the one named *app.yaml* (a plaintext file that you can edit with notepad (on a Mac, use textedit), altering the first line: 
{{{
application: giewiki
}}}
..to name your appspot subdomain in stead of {{{giewiki}}} (One Google account allows you to allocate up to 10 apps/subdomains).

= Deployment =

Actual deployment can be performed using the *appcfg.py* script as described [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadinganapp.html here]

What that page doesn't say, however, is that on some platforms (Windows and Mac), you can launch the process directly from the _Google App Engine Launcher_ which is a GUI app that comes with the App Engine SDK. Just choose *File-Add Existing application* and select the unpacked giewiki folder, that you have modified as described above. Then it will be added to the (initially empty) list, and you can just select it and click the *deploy* button. The deployment process takes a couple of minutes, but there's an output window that shows you what's happening.

If this is _not_ the first version that you deploy to a particular site, you need to explicitly set the new version as the default, using the app engine dashboard at http://appengine.google.com (under Administration/Versions) - this is so that you can revert to the prior version, if needed.

There is currently no way to deploy content together with the code, but if you need to, read http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadingdata.html.

Beware that if you are upgrading an existing application, in some cases it may be a while before it is fully functional, because the server needs to rebuild the indexes which is a task that is queued for batch processing. Under heavy load it may take several hours, but you can monitor the process at appengine.google.com.
