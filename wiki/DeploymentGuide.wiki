How to deploy giewiki at your own appspot site.

= Introduction =

To deploy giewiki to a different site, you have to first edit the *app.yaml* file, changing the first line: 
{{{
application: giewiki
}}}
..to name your appspot subdomain in stead of giewiki.

You may also want to change the line in *static/iewiki.js* that reads:
{{{
SiteUrl: "http://giewiki.appspot.com/",
}}}
which is used for generating an RSS feed (NYI).
