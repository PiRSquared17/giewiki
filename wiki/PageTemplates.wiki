#summary Page templates are templates for pages

= Introduction =

Page templates are defined from existing pages by adding the tag _template_.
Page templates are used in other pages by selecting _Use template.._ in PageProperties.

= Details =

Pages that use a template inherit a copy of the tiddlers on the original page in the specific versions that exist at the time when a template is created (or subsequently updated). This allows the original page to be further developed without affecting the pages that use the template until a new version is ready. If the tag version is also applied to the original page, creating a new version of the template will not replace the previous version.
