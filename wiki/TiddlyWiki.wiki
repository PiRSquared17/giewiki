The amazing personal wiki-on-a-stick
= Introduction =
Originally developed by Jeremy Ruston, TiddlyWiki is an increasingly popular browser script, that implements a single-user wiki within the confines of the web-browser. TiddlyWiki works entirely offline, letting you save your content (together with the TW script) to local files, using either a java applet, windows scripting runtime (in IE) or a Firefox-specific solution.
