Allows you to bring together tiddlers from other pages.


= Details =

If you tag a tiddler includes, the server will interpret Ã­t as a list of tiddlers, specified one per line in the URL format path#name. It will include those tiddlers on the page that has the *includes* tagged tiddler. Optionally, you may also add the tag *curent*, meaning that you want the current version and not any later versions, that may be created afterwards.
