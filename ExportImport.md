A button has been added to the OptionsPanel, that lets you download the current page as a stand-alone TiddlyWiki. It will use a default or a version that you specify on the AdvancedOptions page.

When uploading files, it will treat the filetype .twd as indicating a TiddlyWiki file, that you want to integrate into the current page.
